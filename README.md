## Description

The restaurant is a Mediterranean bistro that serves fusion cuisine, both popular and uncommon dishes from the following countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea: Italy, Greece, Morocco, France, Tunisia, Croatia, Lebanon and Spain. Specific personas developed during the design process were professional, cosmopolitan foodies that travel frequently for both work and leisure, and have a taste for sophisticated high end yet rustic and comforting meals.

The language and imagery have been developed to help transport the user to the Mediterranean, which is intended to encourage patrons to dine at the restaurant. The user interface has been designed to be clean and modern, with a balance of white space, repeated elements and a pop of color consistent with the business logo.
